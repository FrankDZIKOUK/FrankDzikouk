# Hello, I'm Frank Dzikouk! 👋

I'm a passionate quantitative finance student with a Bachelor’s in Mathematics, currently pursuing my studies at École Polytechnique. My interests lie at the intersection of mathematics and quantitative finance, where I enjoy tackling complex problems with rigorous analysis and computational tools. Welcome to my GitHub, where I share projects that reflect my academic journey and enthusiasm for applied mathematics!

## 🔍 About Me
- 🎓 **Education**: 
  - Bachelor’s in Mathematics
  - first year of a Master's degree in mathematic Analysis
  - Current student at École Polytechnique
- 💡 **Interests**: Quantitative finance, stochastic processes, numerical simulations
- 🛠 **Skills**: Python (NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib), Jupyter Notebooks, stochastic modeling, Monte Carlo methods, LaTeX
- 🌟 **Goal**: To leverage mathematical modeling and computational techniques to solve real-world financial challenges

## 🚀 Featured Projects

### [Simulating Extreme Risks in Financial Markets](https://lnkd.in/dk_Qkjjh)
Collaborated on a project at École Polytechnique to quantify extreme risks in unhedged options portfolios. We modeled asset prices using geometric Brownian motion and Black-Scholes, estimating rare event probabilities (e.g., VaR at 99.999%) with methods like naive Monte Carlo, importance sampling, and splitting techniques. 

- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Jupyter Notebooks
- **Key Insight**: Adaptive splitting methods outperformed importance sampling for symmetric portfolios, enhancing rare event estimation.

### [Coprime Integers and Cramér’s Conjecture](https://github.com/your-username/coprime-cramer-project)
Explored the probability of two integers being coprime and simulated Cramér’s conjecture on prime gaps. We proved that the probability of two integers in \([1, n]\) being coprime approximates \( \frac{6}{\pi^2} + O\left(\frac{\ln n}{n}\right) \) using Möbius inversion and inclusion-exclusion. Additionally, we simulated prime gaps to validate \( \limsup_{n} \frac{\mathfrak{p}_{n+1} - \mathfrak{p}_n}{\log(\mathfrak{p}_n)^2} = 1 \).

- **Technologies**: Python, NumPy, Matplotlib, SciPy
- **Key Contribution**: Implemented uniform random sampling and prime gap simulations, visualizing distributions to confirm theoretical results.
